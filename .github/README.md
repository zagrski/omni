# omni

Modular utilities designed to speed up Java development. omni offers a collection of independent modules, allowing you to include only what you needâ€”saving time by avoiding writing boilerplate code and adding unnecessary dependencies.

## Available modules

* omni-common: General utilities that are small and do not yet warrant a separate module, such as helpers for converting strings to booleans or numbers.
* omni-math: Math utilities, including classes for working with 2D and 3D bounding boxes.
* omni-random: Random utilities, including helpers for randomizing booleans, numbers, and elements in arrays and collections, as well as support for chance testing and weighted randomness.
